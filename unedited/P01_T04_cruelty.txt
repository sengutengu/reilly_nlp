lesson you think it's pretty straightforward. I think, uh, animal cruelty is now a felony. Enough. It's in every state. Or if it's on the federal level, might be on state level. Mainly go by state. But I think it is a felony. Um, bad. I think it's pretty safe to say, um, don't like it will not do that. Um, I don't know. It even makes me uncomfortable being over at somebody's house and then the dog, like, trump up on me, and it's not fighting or anything, but they still smack it down. Um, right on the but right on the nose, right on the noggin. And I don't really like that. Um, makes me uncomfortable. I don't know how Mike Vick did what he did. I could never pit one dog against another. Um, yeah. Safe to say I would never do it. Um, it's actually like I feel like a lot of people do not really consider, uh, like the turtles and the bunnies and stuff like that who have just kind of gotten swept under the rug while cats and dogs take the two trophies home. Well, the bench span drove me to take home, but, um yeah, like all animals in general, like people who are killing turtles. And then just like letting hamster down to the lion would go free because they don't want feed him anymore. And I feel like that is also animal cruelty. But people were just like, Oh, it's just a journal. It's not the case. Um, cool. Don't think that I would have really respect somebody who abuse an animal, whether it be a hamster or a dog or another person. Yeah, that also that's a given. So yeah, don't like abusers here? Not a fan of that party. I love my dog.
