My ideal vacation would definitely be somewhere like a resort or probably a beach where you could just lay on the beach all day. Um, have people bringing drinks and food. Definitely unlimited drinks and food would be ideal. Um, and then probably a pool for if you don't want to go to the beach. Um, probably somewhere like Mexico or Jamaica or somewhere like that, um, reading leave the country for a little bit. Um, but along with that, you can go on adventures and stuff, like go on boats. Uh, parasailing. I love very silly. Um, where basically, you can just be, like, pampered and waited on. Um, a spy would be nice, Um, somewhere where you could just hang out with whoever you want with friends or family. I probably want to go friends hang on beach all day, maybe, Like where there's Molly ball. That or something. That would be fine. Um, surf lessons always wanted to serve. Um, definitely. Just where you could get whatever you wanted whenever you needed it. Um, with really nice people all around you meet me people. Um, definitely a beach somewhere. Really warm. Um, and Sonny doesn't ring a lot. Um, where you just channel day? You really good. Uh um, uh, somewhere with room service if you born in. Um
