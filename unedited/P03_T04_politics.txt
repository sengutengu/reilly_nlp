Oh, um, politics. Okay? Politics today. Um well, let's see here. Um, I think it's very divided. I personally don't like how there's, like, a big divide between, like, democrats and Republicans. Could I feel like nothing gets done, and then people are only going after their own political agendas and like going against the other side. So I feel like now politics today is more not so much doing the best for like people, but all Justin's own individual agendas. And I feel like to you, like I feel like politics isn't really like like the media, like is easy for it toe like be skewed or like we don't see the full side of things, which is scary because you don't know what to like, believe or not, which is, like, even scarier, cause how are you supposed to, like vote and make a decision? And you don't know who to trust in politics. And people have their own agendas, which most of the time isn't, um, for the betterment of the country. Um, but yeah, I would say overall politics is very individualistic and improving people's into own agendas and, like going up. Unlike the status, I guess the politics more so than like actually helping people, um, and trying. I'm feeling politicians to just try and get reelected, which I think is an issue. They do things and say things half the time. They don't act on just to become reelected. Trapping is an issue. Okay,
