There is just one more and then or totally gone everything. Um, I think animal cruelty is awful. Um, animal should be respected and loved. Especially pet. Um, like when people take dogs and train them for dog fighting and abuse them. I think it is awful because they could be sweet pets that you should love and especially because then it makes people not like those types of dogs and also they are getting killed and hurt. And I think it's awful. I also think, and cruelty, like veal, is awful. I will never eat feel because I just think that was fourth little and was stuck in the cage. Um, And like abusing animals, like testing products on them, I think is awful. Um, an unnecessary. And I think there has to be a better way to do that that you're not hurting animals in order to yes, better products. Um, I think it's awful, because animals be treated as well as people. All the people that aren't even true. That what a lot of times, um, and they should be loved. And it's seen as the people creatures that they are, um, and definitely not treated the way they are. Um um, And I thing, especially when pets or abuse really bad because you're choosing bring the animal into your home and then abusing that. Um, Okay. Great
