that's how I felt with the cities and diseases. I was like, no clue what to say for these, but I could talk about myself. Yes, I got. Well, maybe we'll see what the second woman really waste. That this wasn't a prompt. I'm going to come out and say that. I think that there is a very heated political atmosphere out there, Um, with Trump, especially what came out today with, um, him, apparently You turning on the troops in Afghanistan because Russia put a bounty out for them. And Trump has been friends with, um, Putin for decent amount of time. And he had it at the summit that friends Very bad time. Does this question? Um, And then there's black loves matter that's going on, which I think is a good thing. Um, and I don't see help people disagree with it. Um, so there's that, um I'm just gonna talk about it in general. I don't have to go by she, but issue, I guess. Um, yeah, I think it's way too heated. There are a lot of disagreements, which I guess you can expect from two party system. Um, but I think that the two teams have read themselves against each other just to kind of say, Hey, you're wrong here. Your own and that kind of sucks, but, um yeah, but Yeah. So that's the politics. Kind of sucks What's going on in almost every aspect, But I guess that's to be expected. But I just hope that good things come in because there's a lot of destruction with both people and places do. Yeah. So hope things get better soon. And people stop being stubborn and learn how to empathize. But that's just mean. Yeah. Oh, my God. Nikki, I Oh, that was my one rule in like that. I don't want to talk about politics. No question.
