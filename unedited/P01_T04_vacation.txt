in your deal Vacation. Okay, so my ideal vacation would probably be hiking again somewhere in the West. Um, ideally, I'd like me and my friends there, and I would like Teoh get in a car and drive all the way. They're stopping along the places like among Montana and, um, a bit this world down and go to die on And, um, Utah and all those places and Arizona. So all my friends would be there. Like I said, Well, my friends from Temple and the other school I went Teoh and some from high school. Uh, I do really wouldn't camp out every night, but I we usually do anyway, is because it's cheaper. Um, yeah, it would just be a fun time. And I would have the ox court because I'm the only one who doesn't suck with what they listen to God, I still, um but yeah, I have a pretty good playlist all along. Um, some recent ones, Some from two thousands. And from 2010 yeah, we'd slide back along and kind of just like a road trip all across the us and then just limping back. And then I'd ideally like to visit my sister in Louisiana. Now that she's pregnant, I could see her. We'd go to her beach house in Pensacola. Um, go to Florida, visit my one friend in Virginia, Uh, leave Hawaii out. Kind of rigged to go there. Too expensive. Don't really care for it. Come back. And ideally, we would be in the Green Zone and I would be able to see everybody because being good ups looks, um, how much longer I have, but I hope it's not very long. So it's like it. Um,
