Okay. So, politics, at least for American politics, it's at this current moment. It's very polarized, Um, the conservative right wing and in the liberal wing, obviously knowing to stay level on the federal level. There is much argument about not only economic issues about the rising, um, tied and how social issues are. Ah are increasing becoming a political issue, as we can see with the krona virus and a black lives movement. For example, mask wearing, um, you, the United States is one of the only countries in the world were wearing a mask is a political issue rather than a public health issue. Same with the black lives matter movement in the United States, we see a lot of racial equality, um, arguments being a political issue rather than a human rights issue. And so as looking to the future as well when we see, I guess more more of these issues turned political. It, I guess, brings up the question on whether the United States can really stay as a united nation or as a united country where, uh, this polarization is able to, I guess, work together and, uh, form a working democracy rather than falling into another civil war like we had over the issues of slavery over a century ago. Um, looking at the state level, um, we see very, um, polarizing degrees and policy issues as well looking at the red states and blue states. And that also feeds in the question of out political polarization and its severity in modern America Looking at the global level. Cool.
