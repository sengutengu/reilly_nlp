um, politics today kind of frustrates me because I feel like a this point. It's really just the two sides wanting to just be each other, which means it not as much about the issues and more just what you can do to get the people on that side to follow you. Um, I think it's very much just we want to beat them, and it frustrates me having a president who I personally don't think is smart or making decisions that are good for this country and just doing what he thinks. The people who support in one, Um, I honestly don't get super involved in politics because it frustrates me and because it tends to give me some anxiety here and felt what's going on right now. And, um, I definitely try to avoid talking about it because I know some people will not to have will just argue and not necessarily listen to what you're saying in politics and just kind of try to be you if their side is different, even if they're not listening to, like, statistics or fax, Um, my roommate, for example, I do not talk about politics with her because she will not listen to you. She will spew out random facts That really just are not true. Um, and I think that it's a lot of fighting and less of what you believe in, Like still what you believe in, but it's a lot more. We just want to win. Um uh, cultic. Ah. I think that things are being brought into politics that are not necessarily politics at this point.
