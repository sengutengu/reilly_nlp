Oh, um, politics. Okay? Politics today. Um well, let's see here. Um, I think it's very divided. I personally don't like how there's, like, a big divide between, like, Democrats and Republicans cause I feel like nothing gets done, and then people are only going after their own political agendas and like going against the other side. So I feel like now politics today is more not so much doing the best for like people, but all politicianâ€™s own individual agendas. And I feel like too, like, I feel like politics isn't really like like the media, like is easy for it to like be skewed or like we don't see the full side of things, which is scary because you don't know what to like, believe or not, which is, like, even scarier, cause how are you supposed to, like vote and make a decision? And you don't know who to trust in politics. And people have their own agendas, which most of the time isn't, um, for the betterment of the country. Um, but yeah, I would say overall politics is very individualistic in improving people's own agendas and, like going up in like the status, I guess the politics, more so than like actually helping people, um, and trying, I feel like politicians too just trying to get reelected, which I think is an issue. So they do things and say things half the time they don't act on just to become reelected, which I think  is an issue.
