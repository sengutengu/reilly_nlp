Okay, so my ideal vacation would probably be hiking again somewhere in the West. Um, ideally, I'd like me and my friends there, and I would like to get in a car and drive all the way there, stopping along the places like, um, in Montana and, um, [UNINTELLIGIBLE] to swerve down and go to Zion, and, um, Utah and all those places and Arizona. Um, all my friends would be there, like I said, all my friends from Temple and the other school I went to and some from high school. Um, ideally we wouldn't camp out every night, but I we usually do anyways because it's cheaper. Um, but yeah, it would just be a fun time. And I would have the aux cord because I'm the only one who doesn't suck with what they listen to. My God, [UNINTELLIGIBLE], um, but yeah, I have a pretty good playlist all along. Um, some recent ones, Some from 2000s, some from 2010. Um, yeah, we'd slide back along and kind of just like a road trip all across the US and then just limping back. And then I'd ideally like to visit my sister in Louisiana. Now that she's pregnant, I could see her. We'd go to her beach house in Pensacola. Um, go to Florida, visit my one friend in Virginia, um, leave Hawaii out. Kind of rigged to go there. Too expensive. Don't really care for it. Come back. And ideally, we would be in the Green Zone and I would be able to see everybody because being cooped up sucks, um, I donâ€™t know how much longer I have, but I hope it's not very long because it's like, eh. Um, [UNINTELLIGIBLE] God!
