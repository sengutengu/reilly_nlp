Yeah. Um, animal cruelty is a big issue, especially in, um, not I mean, I guess not just in the United States, but a lot of nations in which animals are consumed at a high level. Um, like, for example in the United States, um, if I'm not, if I'm not wrong, I think we are one of the highest, if not the highest consumers of beef and that market, um, or this demand of beef, leads to a lot of farmers to resort to very inhumane ways to cultivate and grow these cows so that there's enough beef to meet the demand. And so what we see, especially in this past, I guess century, is massive farms owned by huge corporations, and they'd own, like they own hundreds of thousands of acres in the Midwest and they dedicate it to mass producing cows. But the downside of mass producing cows is that, um, there's no uh, humane way to mass produce anything essentially. And so we see, um, or you see, cows that are that have never seen grass before. They're stuck in these warehouses just being force fed um so they will grow quickly with a bunch of I guess fat and meat. And so when they're butchered and killed, they're able to produce a lot of, uh, meat or beef. Same thing with chickens you've seen a lot of I'm sure there's a lot of videos out there if you just search it up of, uh, chickens being treated inhumanely so that, um they're easily cycled in and out, they're killed as soon as they reach a certain age, a certain mass. And so ah, animal cruelty is a huge issue. And not just in the United States, but mostly every nation that eats meat.
