My ideal vacation would definitely be somewhere like a resort or probably a beach where you could just lay on the beach all day, um, have people bring you drinks and food. Definitely unlimited drinks and food would be ideal. Um, and then probably a pool for if you don't want to go to the beach. Um, probably somewhere like Mexico or Jamaica or somewhere like that, um, where you can leave the country for a little bit. Um, but along with that, you can go on adventures and stuff, like go on boats, uh, parasailing, I love parasailing. Um, where basically, you can just be, like, pampered and waited on, um, a spa would be nice. Um, somewhere where you could just hang out with whoever you want with, whether that be friends or family. I would probably want to go with friends, beach all day, maybe, like where there's a volleyball net or something. That would be fun. Um, surf lessons, always wanted to surf. Um, definitely just where you could get whatever you wanted whenever you needed it. Um, with really nice people all around you meet new people. Um, definitely a beach somewhere really warm, um, and sunny, where it doesn't rain a lot. Um, where you could just tan all day. Read a really good book.  Uh um, uh, somewhere with room service if you wanted, um
