Um, politics today kind of frustrates me because I feel like at this point it's really just the two sides wanting to just beat each other, which means itâ€™s not as much about the issues and more just what you can do to get the people on that side to follow you. Um, I think it's very much just we want to beat them, and it frustrates me having a president who I personally don't think is smart or making decisions that are good for this country and just doing what he thinks the people who support him would. Um, I honestly don't get super involved in politics because it frustrates me and because it tends to give me some anxiety hearing about what's going on right now, and, um, I definitely try to avoid talking about it because I know some people will not have, will just argue and not necessarily listen to what you're saying in politics and just kind of try to beat you if their side is different, even if they're not listening to, like, statistics or facts, um, my roommate, for example, I do not talk about politics with her because she will not listen to you, she will spew out random facts that really just are not true. Um, and I really think that it's a lot of fighting and less of what you believe in. Like still what you believe in, but it's a lot more we just want to win. Um politics, ah, I think that things are being brought into politics that are not necessarily politics at this point.
