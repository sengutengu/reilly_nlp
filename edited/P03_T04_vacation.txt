Um, my ideal vacation would be Paris just because I took French in high school and I’m taking it in college. And my sister also like, practices French. So, like we both sometimes, like, speak French together. So we're not very good at speaking French, but, um, like we've always, like, talked about, like, maybe like, going to Paris and trying it out, and like, seeing, like, all the different, like, tourist attractions. Um, and she even like thought about, like, moving for, like, a couple months to like, near Paris. I wanna say it was like Niece or something to just, like, teach English and French there, um, but she didn't so it would be cool for, like, both her and I to like go there on vacation together. Um, and, yeah, just see the tourist attractions. See the museums. Um, it’d be cool to go during, like, Paris fashion week, but it’d probably be really busy, so maybe not, Um, but yeah, I think it would be cool to say I went to Paris cause I've never been outside of North America before, so that would be cool going to Europe. Um and yeah, we would probably go and see like Eiffel Tower. I'm sure there's, like, good bakeries there. Um, I've heard the people are kind of rude, but probably not. So we'll see. Uh, but yeah, that would definitely be my ideal vacation. Um,
