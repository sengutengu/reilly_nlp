Um, I think animal cruelty is like hard to like have, like a decisive like side cause like it's easy to say, like oh, like, obviously I don't support animal cruelty, but it's hard to like for like like a beauty standpoint, it’s like hard to like fully be, like cruelty free. At least, I think. I mean, you can try and obviously like I'm all like, I do not support animal cruelty, but, like I feel like it's hard and sometimes you don't know I feel like at least from like a beauty standpoint, I guess if you're going from that approach, It's hard to um, fully know which companies are being truthful. I mean, I hope they’re being truthful. Um, and also like I know like for like, fashion at least like the furs and stuff like I know people have an issue with, like fashion and animal cruelty, and I feel like that's like a lot more like easier to, avoid like just don't like buy like fashion products that are made from like animal hides, I guess, I don’t know. And I guess too, I don't know if this counts, but like eating like, I guess, being like a vegetarian again, like I feel, I don't know if this counts, but I feel like if you can do it, great, but I feel like so, for like some people it’s hard based on like their dietary like, um, like their own body I guess you could say so, like, while it would be great to be like, fully vegetarian.
